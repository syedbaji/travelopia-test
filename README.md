Notes:


# I have written some css pre setting styles to neutralize the default behavior of css/html elements on the dom.

# As shown on the pdf, kept header and footer 100px according to that the remaining part will cover space between the both header and footer so I have used the calc method in css styles to get remaining space - check line number 52 OR check styles of main tag

# I chose to keep images in absolute position with some css styles(transform) to satisfy the first condition of the test. In this way we can show the center part of the image irrespective of the display screen’s height.

# To keep text and button over the images, we need to keep text container also in absolute position with the help of css - check “.text-on-image” styles

# I have attached the Jquery library because I am a big fan of that.
